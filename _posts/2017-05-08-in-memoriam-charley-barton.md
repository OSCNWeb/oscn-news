Judge Charley Barton passed away on April 27, 2017 after a life well lived.  He began his judicial service as a County Judge and then served as Associate District Judge for Ellis County until his retirement in 1994.  Prior to becoming a Judge he was an Assistant District Attorney and he was in private practice.  He served Ellis County faithfully, and in addition he was willing to accept assignments in other counties in Western Oklahoma.   He actually presided at many jury trials outside of Ellis County.  He was a veteran and served in Korea for 14 months during his military service from 1953 to 1955.  He is missed by the people of Ellis County and by his many friends and family.
