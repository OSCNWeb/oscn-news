<p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma has launched its new E-Payments system in Cleveland County and Canadian County. The E-Payments system will allow citizens the convenience of paying outstanding court costs and fines online.</p><p>The system provides the public a way to make secure online payments on cases and payment plans with outstanding balances in selected District Courts of Oklahoma.  Currently, the E-payments system is available in Cleveland County and Canadian County only; however, the system will be expanded to other district courts in the near future. </p><blockquote><p>(insert quote…this is an example) “I am excited to be one of the first district courts to accept online payments.  I believe the E-Payment system will save the public and court staff time by reducing courthouse traffic and decreasing the wait times for citizens who still want to pay their court costs in person,” said Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk.</p><p>(insert quote…this is an example) “The convenience of online payments will give defendants an easy way to make routine payments on court-ordered payment plans.” said Marie Ramsey, Canadian County Court Clerk.</p></blockquote><p>The E-Payments system is web-based payment option that can be accessed through the Oklahoma State Courts Network website www.oscn.net.  </p><blockquote><p>(insert quote…this is an example) “I am pleased that our website has been enhanced to allow online payments. I believe this technology will save court staff time and provide a convenience to the citizens of Oklahoma.” said Chief Justice Colbert.</p></blockquote><p>In order to make a payment, an individual will need the case number, if the individual does not have the case number the system provides a search feature in which the individual can look-up a case number by name or other identifiers. Payments can be made by either credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or Discover) or debit card.</p><p>The new E-payments system was developed through the technical efforts of the Administrative Office of the Courts’ MIS Department and uses PayPros as the payment processor.
