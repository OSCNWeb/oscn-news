J. David Rambo, former Associate District Judge in Cleveland County, died May 13, 2019, after a long illness.  Born on June 13, 1936, David Rambo was a lifelong Sooner.  He graduated from Norman High School in 1954; then, completed his BS in Geology at OU in 1958.  After serving as an officer in the Unites States Army from 1958-1960, he returned to Norman and entered law school, earning his law degree from OU in 1962.  That same year, he was admitted to the U. S. District Court, Western District of Oklahoma. During his legal career, he served as both a prosecutor and a judge.  He served as county attorney and municipal judge, as well as serving the district court bench.

David Rambo was a concerned judge and community organizer who collaborated with state and local agencies to develop needed services for children, youth and families.  Serving as County Judge and, later, Associate District Judge, he had responsibility for all juvenile cases in Cleveland County through the 1960s.  Thousands of Oklahoma children and teens benefitted from his early efforts to improve Oklahomaâ€™s juvenile justice system and to provide basic legal rights to minors. In 2009, the Oklahoma Institute for Child Advocacy honored Judge Rambo with a Lifetime Achievement Award as "an Oklahoman who made a difference in the lives of children and youth."

Judge Rambo is survived by his wife, Dr. Laura Boyd; daughters Kristi Braun (Jeff), Vicki Rambo, Susan Thayer, and Brooke Laws (Jacob); and grandchildren Kate Hyde, Josh Braun, Jed Braun, Josie Thayer, Caroline Liu and Henry Liu.

A Come-and-Go Celebration of Life will be held on Saturday, June 1, 2019, from 2-4 p.m., in the OU Courtside Club on the south end of the Lloyd Noble Center, access off GT Blankenship Blvd., Norman, OK.  In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Big Brothers and Sisters of Cleveland County, Crossroads Youth & Family Services and/or Center for Children and Families.
