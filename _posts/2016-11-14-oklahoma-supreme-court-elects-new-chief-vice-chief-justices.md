<p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court today elected new leadership for the next two years, Chief Justice John Reif announced Monday, November 14. The Oklahoma Constitution requires the Court every two years to select from its members a Chief Justice and a Vice Chief Justice.</p>

<p>Combs began his judicial career in 1995 as Special Judge for the Twenty-third Judicial District, serving Pottawatomie and Lincoln Counties.  He was elected District Judge in 2002 and 2006, serving eight years before his appointment to the state’s highest court. Combs and his wife, Janet, have two sons who are also attorneys.</p>
<p>Noma D. Gurich will be the next Vice Chief Justice.  Gurich has been a judge in Oklahoma for more than 25 years.  She served on the Oklahoma Workers’ Compensation Court and twelve-and-a-half years as District Judge for Oklahoma County prior to her appointment to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. </p>

The Chief Justice presides at all court sessions, administers the judicial branch of state government, and represents the Supreme Court and judicial system in public appearances. </p>
<p>Reif, who is concluding two years as Chief Justice, said, "I am confident that the judicial branch of Oklahoma government will continue to thrive under capable leadership of Justices Combs and Gurich."</p>
