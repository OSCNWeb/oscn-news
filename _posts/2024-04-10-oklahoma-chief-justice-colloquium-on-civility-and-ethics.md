---
The Oklahoma Supreme Court is pleased to announce the premier of the Oklahoma Chief Justice Colloquium on Civility and Ethics, the beginning of an annual Oklahoma Bar Association event.

The Colloquium will be held on May 7, 2024, at the Oklahoma Judicial Center and will be streamed for Bar participants.

Presenters this year will be the Honorable Brantley Starr and the Honorable P. Kevin Castel.

Judge Starr is a United States District Court Judge for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas.

Judge Castel is a United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York.

Judge Starr and Judge Castel will discuss the ethical issues of Artificial Intelligence. Judge Castel was the first judge to discover and then fine lawyers for using Chat GPT in a court filing which generated fake case citations. Judge Starr was the first judge to create rules for his court on the use of AI. The judges will discuss their personal scenarios with AI in their courts and engage in a lively discussion on the need for or against AI rules for lawyers.

**The Oklahoma Bar Association will begin accepting registration for this CLE event the week of April 15.**
