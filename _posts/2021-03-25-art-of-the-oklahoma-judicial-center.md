We are pleased to announce that a significant addition has been made to the collection of public art at the Oklahoma Judicial Center. William Bennett Berry has donated a painting of the cover art of the book, "Justice for Sale", written by his grandfather, distinguished Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice William Aylor Berry. The artist is Justice Berry's son, Nick Berry, a nationally recognized artist whose work is held in numerous private and corporate collections across the United States.

Chief Justice Richard Darby noted that, "The Oklahoma Supreme Court has attempted to tell the history of the state of Oklahoma, and of the state's judiciary through the art collection of the Judicial Center. This painting certainly contributes to our story. We hope to resume tours of the Oklahoma Judicial Center Collection later this year."

Justice Berry served in the military during the Second World War. He resigned his position as Payne County attorney and joined the United States Naval Intelligence Service as an ensign during World War II. He was captured by the Japanese in 1942, and he was a POW for thirty-three months. He escaped once, was recaptured, tried twice, and put under a death sentence. Berry was liberated from Bilibid Prison in 1945. He wrote a book, "Prisoner of the Rising Sun" concerning his ordeal as a prisoner. 

Justice Berry had a long and distinguished legal career. He was elected to the Oklahoma Supreme Court in 1958, for a six-year term, was reelected for second and third terms, and served as Vice Chief Justice and Chief Justice before retiring as a Justice in 1978
