title: Tax Referendum Oral Arguments to be Live-Streamed on OSCN
---
The Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website will provide a link for the oral arguments to be held before the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the recent challenges to revenue measures enacted during the 2017 Second Extraordinary Legislative Session.

The same-day scheduling of two oral arguments on issues of statewide interest will take place on Monday afternoon, June 11, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. and 3:00 p.m.  Because of the State Capitol restoration construction, the Supreme Court will meet in the Hearing Room on the 2nd Floor of the Oklahoma Judicial Center.  Due to limited seating in the Hearing Room, any overflow crowd may find seating in the ground floor Auditorium of the Judicial Center, where a live-stream will be provided. Once seating is filled, no standing room will be permitted.

No other photographers or video cameras will be allowed in the Hearing Room.

The live stream can be viewed on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gmthreGnuMM).
