Carol Helen Montgomery, 91, was born in Oklahoma City on July 3rd, 1929 to Albertis and Marie (Cheney) Montgomery. She passed away February 22, 2021 at her home in Forest Park. Carol was the little sister to brothers William and Alan Montgomery. Carol attended Wilson Elementary, Taft Junior High and Classen High School, graduating in 1946. She went to Oklahoma City University where she was in Gamma Phi Beta and graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1950. She met the charming basketball player, Paul Hansen, and they were married from 1951 until his death in 1993. Carol and Coach Paul raised 5 daughters, while welcoming players into their home, providing food, tutoring and advice as needed. She engaged in the traditional roles of homemaking, PTA, and church functions. At age 42, she entered OCU Law School, earned a Juris Doctorate in 1974 and embarked on a long, distinguished career in the legal/judicial field. 

Carol began her career as judicial counsel to Justice John B. Doolin of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. While living in Stillwater, she opened a five-county area office for Legal Aid of Western Oklahoma and served as the managing attorney. She also served as Municipal Judge of the City of Stillwater. In 1984, Carol became Marshall of the Oklahoma Supreme Court. In 1985 she was appointed by Gov. George Nigh as Judge of the Court of Appeals. She was elected to that position in 1986 and was re-elected on statewide retention ballot until her retirement January 1, 2012. In 1993, Carol was elected Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, the first woman to serve as Chief Judge of any appellate court in Oklahoma. Carol was active in the Oklahoma Bar Association, the National Women Judges Association, the Dispute Advisory Board, American Inns of Court and Charter 35. She was involved in various aspects of OCU, served on the Board of Trustees and has been honored with distinguished alumni recognition and the OCU Law School’s Justice Marian P. Opala Award for Lifetime Achievement (2011). Carol was named as a Spotlight Women’s Trailblazer recipient by the Women in Law Conference (1997), honored by Oklahoma City Hospitality Club (2000), Panhellenic Women of the Year (2002), and Oklahoma City Chapter of the Association for Women in Communication Byliner Award (2008). In 2012, Carol was the recipient of the first Ralph B. Hodges-Robert E. Lavender Award for Judicial Excellence given by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

Carol was an active member of Mayflower Congregational Church. At Mayflower, Carol found opportunities to help within the community and develop a close group of friends for book club, movie going and party hosting. Carol’s curiosity and love of learning prompted her to take an auto mechanics class, flying lessons, skydiving, a civilian leadership program with the Department of Defense, and travel to all 7 continents. She dearly loved family gatherings and was happiest when all five daughters were together. 

Carol is predeceased by her parents, brothers, and husband. She is survived by daughters Elizabeth Hatcher (Richard), Patti Hansen (Chris Soldau), Judith Hansen (Phillip Burke), Mary Hamill (Steve Barrow) and Heidi Ferrell (Hoby) and her grandchildren Alan Hatcher, Matthew, Michael, Rachel and Justin Hamill and John and Joshua Palzer and a faithful group of Hansen and Montgomery nieces and nephews. Carol’s family is grateful for the love, care, and dedication of Joane, Linda and Michele.
