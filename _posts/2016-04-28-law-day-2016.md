<p>The tradition of Law Day has a long history of more than 60 years and began here in Oklahoma. Wewoka attorney and OBA Past President Hicks Epton conceived the idea for Law Day in the late 1950s, and it has evolved into a national celebration. </p>
<p>Oklahomans will observe Law Day (officially May 1) with activities and events taking place over several weeks throughout the state.

<p>Law Day celebrates the idea that everyone is entitled to justice, which is one of the fundamental notions of what America is all about. The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States of America states, “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more Perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”</p>
<p>The idea of justice and particularly the rights of those suspected or accused of a crime are prominent in our history and begin in Article III of the Constitution with the right to trial by jury. The importance of protecting the rights of the accused is further illustrated in that four of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution are dedicated to protecting the rights of the accused. These rights are fought for by lawyers in our judicial system, which demands impartiality from members of the judiciary and zealous representation from attorneys on both sides in order to allow a person to confront his accusers while at the same time providing victims and witnesses a forum to have their day in court as well. </p>
<p>Law Day is a great opportunity to highlight and celebrate the work that lawyers do in our communities. Whether from zealous advocacy for our clients, to giving of our time to service organizations and pro bono representation, what lawyers do makes a difference.</p>
