The Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) today announced the three nominees for the judicial vacancy in the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals, District 1, Office 1. After concluding the review process and conducting in person interviews on January 31, 2020, the JNC submitted the following nominees for this position to the Governor:

Matthew D. Day, Tulsa  
Stacie L. Hixon, Tulsa  
Rebecca Brett Nightingale, Tulsa.  

On January 31, 2020, the JNC also met to determine whether the three applicants for the position of Associate District Judge for Woodward County met the legal qualifications for that position. Based on a 2016 Attorney General Opinion, since there were only three applicants, the JNC did not conduct in person interviews for this position. The JNC concluded all three applicants were legally qualified for the position and submitted the following nominees to the Governor:

Careylyn K. Guthrie, Woodward  
Erin N. Kirksey, Mooreland  
Julia A. O’Neal, Durham.  

Under Article 7B Section 4 of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Governor has sixty days to appoint the individuals to these two judicial positions. If he fails to do so within sixty days, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall make the appointments.

On January 31, 2020, the JNC also met to determine whether the three applicants for the position of Judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court of Existing Claims met any applicable legal qualifications for the position. This position was created by 85A Oklahoma Statutes Section 400, and the position is effective July 1, 2020 and requires appointment by the Governor and confirmation by the Senate. Based on the same 2016 Attorney General Opinion, the JNC did not conduct in person interviews for the position. The JNC concluded all three applicants were legally qualified for the position and submitted the following nominees to the Governor:

Margaret Bomhoff, Edmond  
Alvin Jones, Jr., Edmond  
David P. Reid, Tulsa.
