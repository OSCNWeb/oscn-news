The Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) today announced the following individuals have applied for the position of Judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court of Existing Claims:

- Margaret Bomhoff – Edmond
- Alvin Jones, Jr – Edmond
- David P. Reid – Tulsa.

This position was created by 85A Oklahoma Statutes Section 400, and the position is effective July 1, 2020 and requires appointment by the Governor and confirmation by the Senate. The JNC is required to send three nominees to the Governor and, based on a 2016 Attorney General Opinion, will only determine whether the three applicants meet any applicable legal qualifications for this position. Because of that AG Opinion, the JNC will not conduct in person interviews for this position.

On January 31, 2020, the JNC will meet solely for the purpose of evaluating the applications and, if all three applicants are legally qualified, will immediately provide the three nominees to the Governor. If members of the public wish to provide the JNC with comments on any applicant for this position, the comments must be received prior to January 31, 2020. Comments may be mailed to:
