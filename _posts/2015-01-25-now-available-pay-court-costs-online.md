<p><i>Our new e-Payments system allows the public to make secure online payments on cases and payment plans with outstanding balances in <u>Canadian County and Cleveland County.</u></i></p><p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma has launched its new e-Payments system. The public can now make secure online payments on cases and payment plans with outstanding balances in <i>select</i> District Courts of Oklahoma. e-Payments is available now for Cleveland County and Canadian County only, but the Supreme Court of Oklahoma will expand e-Payments to other district courts in the near future. <i>“I have high expectations that e-Payments will free up my staff from numerous phone calls and over the phone payments and allow them to focus on completing other court matters at hand.”</i> said Marie Ramsey, Canadian County Court Clerk. </p><p>e-Payments is simple and convenient, and it will save time for the public and district court staff by decreasing courthouse traffic and wait times. Citizens will no longer have to make frequent trips to the courthouse to make routine payments. Instead, the public may make payments quickly and securely online, anytime from anywhere. <i>"With the growing popularity of online payments, I am pleased that our website has been enhanced to allow this functionality. I believe the e-Payments system will save the citizens of Oklahoma time and money."</i> said Justice Tom Colbert (Chief Justice at the time the e-Payments project began). <i>"I believe one of the biggest benefits of e-Payments is the convenience. Defendants may make payments from home, on vacation, anywhere internet access is available."</i> said Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk.</p><p>e-Payments is a web-based payment system available through the Oklahoma State Courts Network website (www.oscn.net). To make a payment, an individual will need the case number. The system provides a search feature that allows the individual to look up a case number by name or other identifiers. Payments may be made by either credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover) or debit card. </p><p>The Supreme Court’s e-Payments system was developed through the technical efforts of the Administrative Office of the Courts’ MIS Department and uses a third-party payment processor. The MIS Department designed the system with a simple interface that provides easy steps to complete a payment transaction.</p><p>The system is available now in Cleveland and Canadian Counties, so take full advantage of this easy, convenient, and safe payment option today.
