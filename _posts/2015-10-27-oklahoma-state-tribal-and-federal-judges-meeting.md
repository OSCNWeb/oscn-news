<p style="font-size: large; text-align: center;"><strong>NOVEMBER 6</strong></p>   <p>Under the leadership of Judge Jerome A. Holmes, Oklahoma State, Tribal and Federal Judges met at the Sovereignty Symposium last June and reopened a much needed dialogue on the mutual concerns of all members of the judiciary in Oklahoma. The meeting was a wonderful beginning, and the Oklahoma Supreme Court is grateful to all who participated. </p>   <p>This discussion will continue at noon on November 6 in the Great Room of the Oklahoma Judicial Center, 2100 North Lincoln Boulevard, Oklahoma City. All Oklahoma State, Tribal, and Federal Judges are invited to participate. Judge Holmes has again been kind enough to agree to moderate.  Tricia Tingle, the Associate Director for Tribal Justice Support from the Office of Justice Services of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, will also attend the meeting. An informal pizza lunch will be served.</p>   <p>If you have any agenda items, please submit them to the Chief Justice at <a href="mailto:John.Reif@oscn.net" target="_blank">John.Reif@oscn.net</a>. Please RSVP to Justice Kauger at 405-556-9364</p>   <p style="text-align: center;">    <nobr><img style="height: 200px;" src="http://www.oscn.net/assets/img/Thursday-Panels_157.jpg" />    <img style="height: 200px;" src="http://www.oscn.net/assets/img/Thursday-Panels_153.jpg" /></nobr>   </p>
