"Separation of Powers: Framework for Freedom"

All courts in each of the twenty-six judicial districts in Oklahoma are urged to hold Law Day activities. These activities may include courtroom ceremonies, courthouse tours and mock trials. The cooperation of the judges and court clerks is essential for Law Day special events.

This year is the 61st annual nationwide observance of Law Day. Law Day is sponsored by the Oklahoma Bar Association, each of the seventy-seven County Bar Association and the American Bar Association. Law Day programs should be keyed to the 2018 theme: "Separation of Powers: Framework for Freedom."
