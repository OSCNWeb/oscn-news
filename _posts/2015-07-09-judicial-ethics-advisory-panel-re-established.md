<p>Requests for advisory opinions must relate to prospective conduct only and must contain a complete statement of all facts pertaining to the intended conduct, a concise question of judicial ethics, and a memorandum setting forth any research or opinions the judge may have concerning the question and the particular canon in question.</p>
<p>Advisory opinions shall address only whether an intended, future course of conduct violates the Code of Judicial Conduct and shall provide an interpretation of the Code with regard to the factual situation presented. The opinion shall not address issues of law or the ethical propriety of past or present conduct.</p>
<p>Modifications to the Judicial Ethics Advisory Panel have been promulgated to increase the number of active members, memorialize the work and duties of the panel after the adoption of the new Code of Judicial Conduct effective April 15, 2011, and to ratify and affirm the authority of the panel to issue advisory opinions since April 15, 2011.</p>
