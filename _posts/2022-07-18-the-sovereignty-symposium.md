title: The Sovereignty Symposium
---
The Sovereignty Symposium has a very special announcement. There will be a one-day Sovereignty Symposium on September 7, 2022, at the Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City. It will be our thirty-fifth Symposium, held in our thirty-fifth year -- a replacement for the Symposium we did not hold in 2020. This unique event will feature a special keynote speaker to be announced later in the summer. There will also be panels on Ethics by Justice John Reif and Water Law, moderated by John Hargrave. The Symposium will begin at 8:00 a.m. on September 7. On-line registration will be available after July 20, 2022 at https://thesovereigntysymposium.com/.
