[The Sovereignty Symposium](https://thesovereigntysymposium.com/.) has a very special announcement. There will be a one-day Sovereignty Symposium on **September 7, 2022**, at the Skirvin Hotel in Oklahoma City. It will be our thirty-fifth Symposium, held in our **thirty-fifth** year â€” a replacement for the Symposium we did not hold in 2020.  This unique event will feature a special keynote speaker to be announced shortly before the event.  There will also be panels on Ethics by Justice John Reif and Water Law, moderated by John Hargrave. The Symposium will begin at 8:00 a.m. on September 7.

**<u>Because of security requirements there will be no registration after 3:00 p.m. CDT on September 1, 2022.  There will be no walk-ins or registration at the event.</u>**
