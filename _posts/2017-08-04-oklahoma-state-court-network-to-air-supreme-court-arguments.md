title: Oklahoma State Court Network to air Supreme Court Arguments
---

OKLAHOMA CITY - With the assistance of the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (OETA), the Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website will provide a link for the oral arguments to be held before the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the recent challenges to revenue measures enacted in the 2017 legislative session. 

The rare same-day scheduling of three oral arguments on issues of statewide interest will take place in the Supreme Court Courtroom at the State Capitol on Tuesday, August 8 at 9:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., and 11:00 a.m.  Due to an anticipated overflow crowd, the House of Representatives has made available Conference Room 206, where a live stream will be provided to those who cannot find seating in the courtroom.  

No other photographers or video cameras will be allowed in the Supreme Court Courtroom.

OETA will make available a raw video for broadcast television media in the State of Oklahoma following the proceedings.  For more information, contact Jessi Crino at (405) 408-8435 or at [jcrino@oeta.tv](mailto:jcrino@oeta.tv). 

The link to the live-time feed will be found Tuesday on the OSCN website.
