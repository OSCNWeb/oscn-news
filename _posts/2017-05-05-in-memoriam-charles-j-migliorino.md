title: 'In Memoriam: Charles J. Migliorino'
---
Judge Charles J. Migliorino passed from this life on May 3, 2017, quietly, as he had lived, at his home in Bromide.  He was 68 years old. 

Charles Joseph Migliorino was born and raised in the Bronx, New York.  Upon graduation from high school he came to Murray State College in Tishomingo to play basketball.  He placed his academics on hold and joined the United States Marine Corps.  After four tours of Vietnam and two purple hearts, he returned to Oklahoma and chose to make Oklahoma his home.

Charles finished his education at Southeastern State University, in Durant, with a Bachelor’s degree in Social Studies and a Master’s degree in Special Education.

On October 18, 1968, he married Alice Angel.  Charles and Alice have been together for 50 years, with 48 years of marriage.  Charles and Alice have two children, Nicholas and Beth, and six grandchildren.  Charles was devoted to his family, children and grandchildren.    

Charles taught at Ardmore High School for ten years with his best friend, Senator Johnnie Crutchfield.  He was loved and respected by his students, including Judge David B. Lewis of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.

While teaching at Ardmore High School, Judge Migliorino went to night school and obtained his law degree from Oklahoma City University.   
Judge Migliorino served as the Associate District Judge in Johnston County, Twentieth Judicial District of Oklahoma.  He was appointed in October of 2011 by Governor Fallin to fill a vacancy and unexpired term.  He was unopposed for the position in 2014, and served until his passing.  

His experience in private practice, as a prosecutor and first assistant district attorney and his life of service to others gave him a unique perspective and made him an exceptional judge.  

Judge “Mig”, as those of us who worked with him knew him, was always professional and courteous.  He was always willing and eager to discuss a legal issue with other judges and help in any way possible in all of the courts of the District. In 2015, Judge Migliorino presided over a preliminary hearing in Carter County in a racketeering case involving sixteen defendants, which lasted three days.
Judge Migliorino had a life of service to others;  first as a Marine to our country, as a school teacher to his students in the Ardmore Public Schools, as a lawyer to his clients, and as a prosecutor and a judge for the citizens of Johnston County and the State of Oklahoma.

Although Judge Migliorino began his life as a “Yankee” to those of us from Oklahoma, he became one of us, an “Okie,” with his love for his boots, jeans, belt buckles and his cutting horses, and his beloved family ranch.

Judge Migliorino’s thoughtfulness, fairness, honesty and integrity was unquestioned.  He and his unique style, genuineness, camaraderie and friendship will be greatly missed.
