title: The Sovereignty Symposium

<p style="text-align:center">**CANCELLATION ANNOUNCEMENT**</p>

For Thirty-two years, The Sovereignty Symposium has established itself as the premier gathering for the exchange of legal and scholarly discussions regarding and relating to Native American Law. We are always mindful of not only the intellectual contributions of our faculty and attendees, but of their efforts to travel to the Symposium from all parts of Oklahoma, the United States, Canada, and Europe. The current circumstances surrounding the COVID 19 virus have necessitated curtailments to travel and to gatherings. This leads us to conclude that The Sovereignty Symposium currently scheduled for June 10-11, 2020, in Oklahoma City must be cancelled. Safety and health are our priority. We look forward to seeing you on June 9-10, 2021 in Oklahoma City at the Skirvin Hotel. Current registrations will be carried over to 2021, unless a refund is requested. Refunds will be made when our office fully reopens.

The Sovereignty Symposium was established to provide a forum in which ideas concerning common legal issues can be exchanged in a scholarly, non-adversarial environment. The Supreme Court espouses no view on any of the issues, and the position taken by the participants are not endorsed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma.
