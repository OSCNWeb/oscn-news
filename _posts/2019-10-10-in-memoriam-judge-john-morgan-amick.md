Judge Amick was known as a kind man and honorable judge. Many an Oklahoma County attorney tried their first case in front of Judge Amick. He never tired of the legal profession and was always willing to help new and not-so new attorneys whenever called upon. He was born on January 31, 1923. He graduated from high school in Jefferson, Oklahoma in 1941. Upon graduation he attended Oklahoma A & M (now, Oklahoma State University), where he was in the ROTC, until the war broke out. During the war he served in the U. S. Army as a machine gun platoon leader. When he returned from the war he attended law school at the University of Oklahoma while remaining in the Oklahoma National Guard. While in law school he met with wife Jean. They were married 68 years before she passed away. 

During his distinguished legal career he served in a number of positions including County Attorney for Grant County, Assistant United States Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, County Judge, Law School Professor at Oklahoma City University, spent some time in private practice, and from 1978-1998 served as an Oklahoma County District Judge. He was a member of the Oklahoma County Bar Association and served as the OCBA President in 1977. He loved to sing and was a member of the choir at Crown Heights United Methodist Church. He performed at Lyric Theatre and was a member of the Downtown Kiwanis Club. He and Jean had five children and six grandchildren. He will be missed.
