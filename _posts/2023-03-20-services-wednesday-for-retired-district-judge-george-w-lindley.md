title: Services Wednesday for Retired District Judge George W. Lindley
---
George W. Lindley, retired District Judge from Duncan, died Friday, March 17, 2023, after a brief illness.  He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Oklahoma in 1967, and his law degree from the University of Texas Law School in 1970.  During law school George received a Ford Foundation Fellowship to act as a legal advisor to inmates in the Texas Department of Corrections.  Upon graduation from law school, he served as law clerk to the Honorable William J. Holloway, judge of the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.  He always looked to Judge Holloway as a mentor.  

Lindley returned to his hometown of Duncan to enter the private practice of law and June 3, 1974, was selected by the District Judges of the 5th Judicial District to serve as Special Judge for Stephens County.  On April 19, 1976, Governor David L. Boren appointed Lindley to serve as Associate District Judge and, after winning his election in November 1978, Lindley took the oath of office on January 8, 1979, as District Judge for the 5th Judicial District, Office 2.  That was the only time he had an opponent in 30+ years of judicial service.  

Concerned about the lack of procedures for collection of financial obligations owed to the courts, Judge Lindley authored a Court Costs Collection Manual which was distributed by the Administrative Office of the Courts to district courts throughout Oklahoma.  Lindley also conducted training for judges and court clerks to become familiar with best practices in cost collections.  He was known across the state as the authority on cost collections.

The judges of the eleven counties in the Southwest Judicial Administrative District elected Lindley to serve as Presiding Judge, a position that assists the Chief Justice in the administration of the courts in a region. He was elected to serve as the Chairman of the Assemble of Presiding Judges in 1997.  Lindley’s knowledge of the law, adherence to constitutional principles, and attention to detail served as an example for all who practiced in his courtroom.  To many of his judicial peers, he was considered “a Judge’s Judge”.  

Judge Lindley retired from the judiciary January 2004; but he did not retire from public service.  Governor Brad Henry appointed him to serve on the Board of Juvenile Affairs, the governing body for the Office of Juvenile Affairs.  Lindley served eight years on the volunteer OJA Board, including as Board Chairman.  

George was a history buff and avid reader all his life. His love of history and reading was probably the reason he made an immersive and captivating storyteller himself. He was devoted to the Civil War. His brother acquired a Civil War era cannon, and for years they participated in artillery competitions at Fort Sill, making their own ammunition and standing for hours in the Oklahoma heat in wool uniforms from the period. These efforts did not go unrecognized, as George was awarded the Order of Saint Barbara, the order for artillerymen.

George is survived by his wife, Susan; son, Sean, and daughter-in-law, Alisabeth; granddaughter, Grace; and sister, Joan. His brother, David, preceded him in death.

Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday, March 22nd, at the First Christian Church in Duncan. Online condolences can be made at [www.whittfh.com](www.whittfh.com). In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Duncan Regional Hospital or the First Christian Church of Duncan, Oklahoma.
