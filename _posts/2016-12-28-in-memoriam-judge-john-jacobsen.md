<p>Special Judge John Jacobsen passed away the morning of December 25, 2016 at the age of 58.  Judge Jacobsen was appointed by the Oklahoma County District Judges and took the bench on August 15, 2011, serving his entire judicial career as a Juvenile Court Judge. He received his undergraduate degree in English from Brigham Young University in 1983 and his Juris Doctorate from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1986.</p>
<p>After graduating from law school, Jacobsen worked for the Municipal Counselor's Office in the City of Oklahoma City in their Civil Litigation section. In 1988, he was hired by the Oklahoma County District Attorney's Office as an assistant district attorney to work in the Civil Division advising county officials and representing government officials in state and federal litigation.</p>
<p>Appointed Civil Division Director in 1995, Jacobsen worked in that position until January 1999, when he was promoted to First Assistant. He served as First Assistant for two District Attorneys, then became the Civil Division Director and held that position until his appointment to the bench. Much of his time as Civil Division Director was spent in federal litigation and with matters closely associated with the Board of County Commissioners of Oklahoma County.</p>
<p>Judge Jacobsen is survived by his wife, Dr. Nancy Jacobsen, a professor of Prosthodontics at the University of Oklahoma School of Dentistry, four sons and three grandchildren.  A private service is planned for the family with a memorial service at a later date. The public memorial service will be January 7th at 2:00 p.m. at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 5020 NW 63rd, Oklahoma City</p>
