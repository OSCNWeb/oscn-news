Former Oklahoma County District Judge William R. “Bill” Burkett died on May 23, 2019.  Bill was born in Oklahoma City on November 2, 1925, and attended public schools in Oklahoma City and Norman.  Destined for the military, he also attended Allen Military Academy, Bryan, Texas, and Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri.  He graduated from Kemper as Cadet Corps Commander in 1944, the 100th anniversary of the school, and, later, from OCS at Fort Benning, Georgia, as a second lieutenant, Infantry, after which he served in the Philippines and Japan.  Upon returning home, he married his wife, Phoebe, and entered the OU law school. After finishing law school, the couple moved to Woodward in 1950 to begin raising a family.  

Bill was called back to active duty to serve during the Korean War, and returned to his practice of law in Woodward.  He served as State Representative for Woodward County, and City Attorney for Woodward, Fort Supply and Seiling.  In 1969, Bill was appointed U. S. Attorney for the Western District of Oklahoma, so the family moved to Oklahoma City. Under Governor Henry Bellmon, Bill served as chairman of the Human Services Commission, member of the State Tax Court, and District Judge. Governor Frank Keating named Bill as chairman of the Indigent Defense Commission and, again, as District Judge.

He was a founding member and Master Emeritus of the William J. Holloway Inn of Court.  He served as president of the Oklahoma Bar Foundation, the Woodward County, Oklahoma County and Federal Bar Associations.  

He was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 69 years, Phoebe and is survived by his four children, Bana Roberts (Wilson), Jerry Burkett (Debbie), Jim Burkett (Brenda), and Julie Taylor (Sherwood); and ten grandchildren; and nineteen great-grandchildren.
