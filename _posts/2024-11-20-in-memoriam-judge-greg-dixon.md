Gregory Ben Dixon was born on December 16, 1966 in Muskogee, Oklahoma, one of three children born to Leon Benjamin Dixon and Barbara Elouise (Williams) Dixon. He was primarily raised in Checotah, Oklahoma where he attended school and graduated with the Wildcat Class of 1985. From there, Greg continued his educational and athletic career at the University of Oklahoma. During his undergraduate studies, Greg was a member of the OU football team, achieving three conference championships and one national title, and he lettered all four years. He graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration and later earned his Juris Doctorate in 1994 from the University of Oklahoma College of Law. Greg was driven, dedicated, and passionate about his profession. With experience in both public and civil litigation, he was elected in 2011 as District Judge for Cleveland, McClain, and Garvin counties, where he also served as a Supervising District Judge for McClain and Garvin counties. Greg was grateful for his four years on the bench that equipped him with extensive knowledge and experiences. He eventually returned to private practice law, and became partners at Nichols Dixon Law. Although his list of accomplishments and accolades could fill the page, Greg’s greatest passion was reserved for his family. He enjoyed cooking and grilling, and hosting family get-togethers and was known to be an incredibly talented carpenter and craftsman; he was the designated handy man! Greg was a man of great faith, and it was his faith in Jesus that carried him through life’s trials and adversities. He led multiple bible studies throughout the years, and one more recently called, Stand Ministry. He also served on various ministry boards and participated in many organizations and clubs, such as Sooner brotherhood, Rotary, and the Chamber of Commerce. He truly had a servant’s heart. Greg lived his life consistently, humbly, and boldly walking with Jesus. He was fun-loving, generous, and extremely caring in nature. He truly was the lifeblood of the family. Greg was a loving and devoted husband, father, grandfather, brother, and a true friend. He will be dearly missed!

He was preceded in death by: his father, Leon Dixon.

Greg is survived by: his loving wife Gina Dixon of the home; son, Elijah Ben Dixon of Norman; daughters, Jordan Dale Terry and husband Kyle of Washington and Hannah Lynn Treadaway and husband Isaac of Washington; mother, Barbara Dixon of Checotah; sister, Tina Swayze and husband Jerry of Purcell; brother, Dru Dixon and wife Kelli of Talala; 4 grandchildren, Mia and Griffin Terry, and Lottie and Shepherd Treadaway, several nieces, nephews, cousins, and a host of other family and friends.
