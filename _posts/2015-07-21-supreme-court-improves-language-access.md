	<p>The Oklahoma Supreme Court and the State Board of Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters have enrolled the first group of Registered Courtroom Interpreters in the State of Oklahoma. After much preparation, the first round of training and testing is complete, and there are now 18 new Registered Interpreters to help provide language access in the Oklahoma courts. Debra Charles, General Counsel for the Administrative Office of the Courts and Director of the Court Interpreter Program, stated that, "Qualified interpreters help courts function more efficiently and effectively. These Registered Interpreters have completed a highly focused two-day training, and they have been tested for proficiency in both English and in the foreign language. We are very excited that this first group of Registered Interpreters is now available for our courts." </p>
	<p>Last year, the Supreme Court appointed members to the Board of Examiners of Certified Courtroom Interpreters. The current Board members are: Linda Dyer, Honorable Cindy Truong, Rita Lyons, Cam H. Ly, Joni Bice, and Jason King, ex officio member.</p>			
	<p>The Court Interpreter Program officially launched this spring with two orientation training programs and exam opportunities for Registered Interpreters. The attendees received intensive training in legal terminology, courtroom proceedings, professionalism, and ethics for courtroom interpreters. Chief Justice John F. Reif greeted each of the two classes and commended the candidates for working to achieve an Oklahoma courtroom interpreter credential.</p>

	</div>					
	<p>The 18 newly-enrolled Registered Courtroom Interpreters now appear in the Registry of Registered Courtroom Interpreters, available on the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/static/forms/aoc_forms/interpreter.asp" target="_blank">Courtroom Interpreters</a> section of OSCN. An interpreter who has become a Registered Courtroom Interpreter in Oklahoma is then eligible to take the oral examination to become a Certified Courtroom Interpreter. Certification indicates the highest skill level for a court interpreter and is the generally-recognized standard in most state court systems. Currently, there are four Certified Interpreters listed on the Supreme Courtâ€™s Registry of Certified Interpreters.</p>
	<p>Additional training and testing events are scheduled for the fall of 2015. Information is available under the heading, "Registered Courtroom Interpreter Training Program," on the <a href="http://www.oscn.net/static/forms/aoc_forms/interpreter.asp" target="_blank">Courtroom Interpreters</a> section of OSCN .</p>
	<p>Enrollment is now open for the fall classes. Space is limited and tends to fill quickly, so apply early to reserve your seat.</p>
