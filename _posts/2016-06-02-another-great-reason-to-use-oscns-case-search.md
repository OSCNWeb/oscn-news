For over sixteen years, the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s website, OSCN.net, has provided case record searches for millions of records in the Appellate Courts and thirteen of Oklahoma’s District Courts, including the state’s two most populous counties, Oklahoma and Tulsa Counties. However, recently the site expanded its case search to include eight additional Oklahoma District Courts. This means the public may now perform free case record searches in the Appellate Courts and 76 District Courts!

This searchable online database was designed and developed by the MIS Division of the Administrative Office of Courts (AOC). This technology does not replace the two case management systems used by the district courts to file cases and pleadings, instead it provides the public a centralized location to search court records and view related documents.

OSCN's case search is a free service that provides the public a convenient way to search for court records in the district and appellate courts by case number, name, date of birth, and other identifiers. Search results are fast, and case information is available almost immediately after being processed by the court clerk's office. In addition to online case information, site visitors may view court-related documents online; however, document availability will vary by district court.

The MIS Division began its OSCN Statewide Case Search Project in 2015. The initial release included five district courts that were added in February, 2015, and seven more added shortly thereafter. These releases allowed the MIS Division to better understand the various formatting of disparate databases and images found within the case management system used by 64 district courts. Once the MIS Division developed a repeatable process to capture this disparate case information it was able to release 51 district courts in 2016. The MIS Division is extremely pleased about these successful releases, and believes this experience will be beneficial in future data projects.
