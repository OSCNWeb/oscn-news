<p>During the month of January, 2016, the Oklahoma Supreme Court added 12 additional district courts to its online case search. With this expansion, visitors to the OSCN website now have the capability to search public records in 37 District Courts and in the Appellate Courts. This free service provides the public a convenient way to search for court records by case number, name, date of birth, and other identifiers. Search results are fast, and case information is available almost immediately after being processed by the court clerk's office. In addition to online case information, site visitors may view court-related documents online; however, document availability will vary by district court.</p>

<p>During the month of January, 2016, the Oklahoma Supreme Court added 12 additional district courts to its online case search.

Search results are fast, and case information is available almost immediately after being processed by the court clerk's office. In addition to online case information, site visitors may view court-related documents online; however, document availability will vary by district court.</p>
<p>The OSCN website is designed and developed by the MIS Division of the Administrative Office of Courts (AOC). The case search project is an extensive effort to integrate all 77 district courts' data into OSCN's searchable online database. This online database does not replace the two case management systems used by the district courts; instead, it provides a centralized location for the public to search court records and view related documents.</p>
<p>The initial expansion of case search began with five district courts added in February, 2015, and seven more added shortly thereafter. These successful releases by the MIS Division have paved the way for establishing the technology needed to provide Oklahoma with a statewide online case search. Look for additional district courts to be added to OSCN's case search in the very near future!
