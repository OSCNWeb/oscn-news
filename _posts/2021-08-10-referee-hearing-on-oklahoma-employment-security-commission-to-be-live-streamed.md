title: Referee Hearing on Oklahoma Employment Security Commission to be Live-Streamed
---
Because the Oklahoma Judicial Center is closed to outside groups, Chief Justice Richard Darby said today that two cases involving the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission and scheduled for hearing before one of the Supreme Courtâ€™s referees on Wednesday, August 11, 2021, would now be live-streamed.

Case No. 119,710, Michella Stewart, et al, v. Kevin Stitt and Oklahoma Employment Security Commission is set for 10:30 a.m., with Case No. 119,782, Shelley Zumwalt v. The Honorable Anthony L. Bonner, to immediately follow.  Both cases will be presented to the referee in the Hearing Room at The Oklahoma Judicial Center.

The Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) will provide a live-stream of the proceedings.  The link to the live-time feed will be found August 11 on the OSCN website approximately sixty minutes before the hearing begins.

No other photographers, video cameras or recording devices will be allowed in the Hearing Room.
