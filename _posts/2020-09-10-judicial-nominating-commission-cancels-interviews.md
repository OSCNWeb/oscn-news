One of the four announced candidates for the position of District Judge for Tulsa and Pawnee Counties (Fourteenth Judicial District, Office 5) has voluntarily withdrawn his application, leaving three applicants for this position:

> Lewis A. Berkowitz, Edmond  
> Michelle L. Bodine-Keely, Pawhuska  
> Glen L. Dresback, Cleveland  

The JNC is required to send three nominees to the Governor. Based on a 2016 Attorney General Opinion, the JNC will only determine whether the three applicants meet the applicable legal qualifications for this position. Because of that AG Opinion, the JNC will not conduct the previously announced in person interviews for this position. Rather, on September 29, 2020, the JNC will meet solely for the purpose of evaluating the applications and, if all three applicants are legally qualified, the JNC will immediately provide the three nominees to the Governor. If members of the public wish to provide the JNC with comments on any applicant for this position, the comments <u>must be received prior to September 29, 2020</u>. Comments may be mailed to:

> Administrative Office of the Courts  
> Attn: Tammy Reaves  
> 2100 North Lincoln, Suite 3  
> Oklahoma City OK 73105 and/or  

> Jim Webb  
> Chair, Judicial Nominating Commission  
> Chesapeake Energy Corporation  
> P.O. Box 18496  
> Oklahoma City OK 73154-0496.
