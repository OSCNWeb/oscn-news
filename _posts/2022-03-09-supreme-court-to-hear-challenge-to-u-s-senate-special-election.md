title: Supreme Court to Hear Challenge to U. S. Senate Special Election
---
Chief Justice Richard Darby announced that the challenge filed in No. 120,253, styled Stephen Jones, Petitioner, vs. Paul Ziriax, Secretary of the Oklahoma State Election Board, Respondent, will be heard by the Court en banc on Wednesday, March 23, 2022, at 1:30 p.m., in the Courtroom of the Supreme Court on the second floor of the State Capitol.  The original action challenges the setting of the special election to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of United States Senator Jim Inhofe.  

The Oklahoma State Court Network (OSCN) website will provide a link for the oral argument.  The link to the live feed will be available March 23 on the OSCN website.
