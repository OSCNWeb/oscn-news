title: Press Release - JNC Woodward
---
The Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) today announced the following individuals have applied for the position of Associate District Judge for Woodward County:

- Careylyn K. Guthrie, Woodward
- Erin N. Kirksey, Mooreland
- Julia A. O'Neal, Durham

The JNC is required to send three nominees to the Governor and, based on a 2016 Attorney General Opinion, will only determine whether the three applicants meet the legal qualifications for the position of Associate District Judge. Because of that AG Opinion, the JNC will not conduct in person interviews for this position.
On January 31, 2020, the JNC will meet solely for the purpose of evaluating the applications and, if all three applicants are legally qualified, will immediately provide the three nominees to the Governor. If members of the public wish to provide the JNC with comments on any applicant for Woodward County Associate District Judge, the comments <u>must be received prior to January 31, 2020</u>. Comments may be mailed to:
