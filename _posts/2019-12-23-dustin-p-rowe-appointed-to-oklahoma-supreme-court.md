<img style="width: 110px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://www.oscn.net/images/news/dustin-rowe.jpg" />Tishomingo attorney Dustin P. Rowe recently joined the Oklahoma Supreme Court and became the second appointment of Governor Kevin Stitt to the state’s highest court.  Rowe’s appointment to the office of Supreme Court District 2 covering counties in southeast Oklahoma fills the vacancy created last spring by the appointment of Justice Patrick Wyrick to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.

A lifelong resident of Tishomingo, Rowe earned his B.A. with honors from East Central University and his J.D. from the University of Oklahoma College of Law.  Since 2001, he has maintained his law practice on Main Street in Tishomingo.  While a practicing attorney, Rowe represented clients in more than 25 different Oklahoma district courts.  He was named a Special Judge of the Chickasaw Nation District Court from 2005 – 2011, and has served as District Judge of the Chickasaw Nation District Court from 2011 to the present.  During his tenure as a Chickasaw District Court Judge, Rowe presided over more than 10,000 cases, including hundreds of child welfare cases and adoptions.  

Rowe made history in 1994, when at 18 years of age he was elected Mayor of Tishomingo during his senior year in high school.  He was reelected to a second term as the state’s youngest mayor.  Rowe also served his local community as chairman of the Johnston County Bar Association.  He and his wife, Nicole, have two adult children, a son attending Oklahoma City University School of Law and a daughter in college at the University of Oklahoma.

A public oath ceremony and reception will be held Monday, February 24th at 2pm.
