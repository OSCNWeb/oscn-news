The Judicial Nominating Commission (JNC) today announced the three nominees for the judicial office of Associate District Judge, Sixteenth Judicial District, Latimer County, Oklahoma, a vacancy created by the retirement of the Honorable William Welch on August 1, 2021. The JNC received three applications for this position. Based on a 2016 Attorney General Opinion, the JNCâ€™s obligation in this situation was to determine if the three applicants meet the minimum legal qualifications for the position. The JNC has determined all three do meet those qualifications, and the JNC has submitted the following nominees for this position to the Governor:

- David K. Hale, Talihina
- Margaret S. Nicholson, Red Oak
- Frank N. Raunikar, Wilburton

Under Article 7B Section 4 of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Governor has sixty days to appoint one of the nominees to this judicial position. If he fails to do so within sixty days, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court shall make the appointments.
