Applications are now being accepted for contract attorneys to represent parents in deprived juvenile matters. Contracts are available for part-time (2-3 days per week) or full-time (5 days per week). Please include a resume with any experience in juvenile deprived proceedings specifically noted. You must be able to meet attorney-client ethical obligations by not only appearing in court, but by meeting with clients prior to hearings in order to be fully prepared. Additionally, please indicate if you are willing to accept appeals and/or whether you would be willing to contract solely as an appellate attorney in these matters.
