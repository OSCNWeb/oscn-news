John Kane IV to the Supreme Court, District No. 1, filling a vacancy created by the retirement of Justice John F. Reif.  The selection of Justice Kane was Governor Kevin Stitt’s first appointment to the state’s highest court.

Prior to his appointment as justice, Kane served as District Judge for the 10th Judicial District for 14 years.  During his tenure he served as president of the Oklahoma Judicial Conference, 2013-2014; as presiding judge of the Northeastern Judicial Administrative, 2019; and as presiding judge of the Trial Division of the Court on the Judiciary, 2019.

Kane began his practice as an attorney at Kane, Kane & Kane Law Offices, a law firm started by his father and grandfather in Pawhuska. During his years in private practice, he also served the Oklahoma Department of Human Services – Child Support Division as an administrative law judge.  From 1987-1989, he served Osage County as an assistant district attorney.

A graduate of Oklahoma State University in agricultural economics and accounting, he received his law degree from the University of Oklahoma college of Law.  Kane and his wife, Cyndi, have been married for 33 years and have four children.

Although Justice Kane has already begun his official duties, a public celebration and swearing in ceremony will be held Monday, December 9, at 2:00 p.m., in the Supreme Court Courtroom at the State Capitol.
