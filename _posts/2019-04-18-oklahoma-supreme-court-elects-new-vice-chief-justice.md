We announce the election of Justice Richard Darby to serve as the Vice Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, effective April 15, 2019.  Justice Darby of Altus served as district judge for district three for twenty-three years.  For eight of those years the counties included Jackson, Tillman, Kiowa, and Washita, and for the last fifteen years, Harmon and Greer Counties in place of Washita.  Prior to serving as district judge, Justice Darby served as special judge for four years and associate district judge for four years, both in Jackson County.  Governor Fallin appointed Justice Darby on April 4th to fill the unexpired term of now retired Justice Joseph M. Watt.  Darby was graduated from Duke High School, then from Southwestern Oklahoma State University before receiving his Juris Doctor Degree from the University of Oklahoma.

Justice Darby is married to Dr. Dana Darby who is the Head of School at Altus Christian Academy.  They have two adult sons.   
 
Since January 2019, the position of Vice Chief Justice was held by Justice Patrick Wyrick.  He resigned from the Supreme Court to accept the position of United States District Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma.  Shortly after he was confirmed by the Senate and received his commission from President Donald Trump,  Judge Wyrick was sworn in by The Honorable Joe Heaton.  Judge Wyrick served on the Supreme Court of Oklahoma from February 2017 to April 12, 2019, after six years as solicitor general under the Attorney General of the State of Oklahoma.
