Chief Justice M. John Kane IV announces that the Oklahoma Supreme Court has selected Acting Director Diana O'Neal as the new Administrative Director of the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), effective September 1, 2024. She will succeed the Hon. Jari Askins, who retired in June.

Prior to being named Acting Director, Ms. O'Neal served as Deputy Administrative Director and Chief Financial Officer for the Courts. Ms. O'Neal is a Certified Public Accountant and graduate of Southwestern Oklahoma State University. Her background includes executive level positions within other state entities. Following graduation, she began her state service with the Office of the State Auditor and Inspector. Most notable in her more than 25 years in state government, she served as Deputy Administrator and Chief Financial Officer for the Employees Group Insurance Division of the Office of Management Enterprise Services.

According to Chief Justice Kane, "Diana has a proven track record of strong financial management and professional leadership she brings to the Courts. In her role as our Chief Financial Officer, she led initiatives to modernize our administrative operations and she continues to foster a culture of teamwork throughout the AOC. Diana has earned the respect of the Justices and her team with her competence and integrity, making her a perfect fit as Administrative Director of the Courts."

"I grew up in the Oklahoma panhandle with a family that had great passion for the State of Oklahoma and service to our citizens", Ms. O'Neal said. "I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving our state in this new role as the AOC works to support and assist the Oklahoma judicial branch. I am also thankful to have spent the last few years learning the court system administration under the mentorship of Ms. Askins."

Diana and her husband reside in Choctaw and are the parents of three adult children.
