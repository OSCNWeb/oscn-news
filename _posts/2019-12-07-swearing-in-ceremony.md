Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice M. John Kane IV will take his oath of office in a public ceremony on Monday, December 9, at 2:00 p.m., in the Supreme Court Courtroom at the State Capitol, 2300 N. Lincoln, Oklahoma City. Justice Kane was the first appointment by Governor Kevin Stitt to the stateâ€™s highest court. Kane, a native of Pawhuska, most recently served 14 years as District Judge for the 10th Judicial District.  

Due to restoration and construction projects inside the State Capitol, accessibility to the 2nd floor courtroom may take longer than usual. Parking for the ceremony is available in the large parking lot south of the capitol building. Following the oath of office ceremony, a reception will be held in the Great Room at the Oklahoma Judicial Center, 2100 N. Lincoln.
