<p><strong>FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS MUST BE FILED ELECTRONICALLY</strong><br><strong>Paper Filings Are Not Sufficient</strong></p><p>Rule 3 of the Ethics Rules of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission requires judges and Justices to file annual Financial Disclosure Statements. </p><p><strong>The statements for calendar year 2014 are due on May 15, 2015. <em style="color: red;">Effective January 1, 2015, Rule 3.10 requires that Financial Disclosure Statements must be filed electronically.</em> Paper statements are not sufficient. The forms previously used for filing financial disclosures (F-1R and F-3R) are no longer being used by the Commission. There is a new form that will be used by the electronic filing system.</strong></p><p><strong>Please note that the new system for electronic filings is not yet operational, so the Ethics Commission is not yet able to accept electronic filings.</strong> The Commission expects the system to be online by early April. The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC), the courts’ liaison to the Ethics Commission, has provided a list of required filers, including email addresses, to the Commission. When the Commission’s new electronic filing system is operational, the Commission will notify all required filers by email at the addresses on the AOC’s list.</p><p>The Ethics Commission reports that some judges have already submitted their Financial Disclosure Statements in paper format. The Ethics Commission advises if you have already filed (or are considering filing) paper statements, you will have to file again, electronically, when the system becomes operational. </p><p>If you have questions, you may contact Tammy Reaves at the AOC at (405) 556-9862 or <a href="mailto:tammy.reaves@oscn.net">tammy.reaves@oscn.net</a>. You may also contact Roberta "Bert" Hale at the Ethics Commission at (405) 521-3451 or <a href="mailto:ethics@ethics.ok.gov">ethics@ethics.ok.gov</a>.
