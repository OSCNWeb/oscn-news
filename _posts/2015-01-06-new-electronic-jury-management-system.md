It's also producing cost savings.</i></p><p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma continues the successful installation of its new statewide electronic jury management system. The system was recently installed in fourteen additional district courts, bringing the total to thirty district courts now using the system to mail summonses to potential jurors and check-in prospective jurors.</p><p>On May 15, 2014, Cleveland County became the first district court to use the new jury management system. Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk, used the system to generate approximately 583 summonses that were mailed to prospective jurors. This system allows summonses to be mailed from a central automated mailing service, thereby saving costs on postage and staff time previously needed to print and mail summonses from individual counties. <i>"The automated mailing service has saved Cleveland County time and money. This system checks all addresses against the National Change of Address database which reduces the number of summonses that were returned undeliverable,"</i> said Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma continues the successful installation of its new statewide electronic jury management system. The system was recently installed in fourteen additional district courts, bringing the total to thirty district courts now using the system to mail summonses to potential jurors and check-in prospective jurors.</p>
<p>On May 15, 2014, Cleveland County became the first district court to use the new jury management system. Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk, used the system to generate approximately 583 summonses that were mailed to prospective jurors. This system allows summonses to be mailed from a central automated mailing service, thereby saving costs on postage and staff time previously needed to print and mail summonses from individual counties. <i>"The automated mailing service has saved Cleveland County time and money. This system checks all addresses against the National Change of Address database which reduces the number of summonses that were returned undeliverable,"</i> said Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk.</p>
<p>After prospective jurors receive the summons, the system allows the jurors to use an automated telephone response system or to log-in to a website to: request to be excused or disqualified; request a deferment of their service to a later date; or confirm they will be reporting on that date. The district court can confirm or deny these requests either by placing an automated telephone call back to the prospective juror or by sending an e-mail response to requests made through the website. Mrs. Hall said, <i>"We can quickly send an individual or mass e-mail message or telephone message to prospective jurors informing them when situations change in the courtroom or reminding them when they need to report."</i></p>
<p>In addition to a centralized automated mailing service and automated telephone system, the system provides district courts the capability to select jurors randomly, check-in jurors, assign and manage jury panels, and calculate claims to pay jurors. Cleveland County used these system functions during its jury check-in held on June 9, 2014. Mrs. Hall said, <i>"This system has many time saving features that have helped during jury check-in. It now takes us less time to check-in jurors and collect oaths on the first day of the jury term."</i> </p>
<p>The jury management software is provided by Courthouse Technologies. The MIS Division of the Administrative Office of the Courts has configured the local county systems and provided customized training and on-site support to district courts during their initial jury check-in process. <i>"I am extremely pleased with the progress of the electronic jury management system. This technology has already saved time and reduced costs in several counties, as well as provided a more seamless and efficient process for citizens that are asked to serve as jurors,"</i> said Justice Tom Colbert (Chief Justice at the time the Jury Management project began).</p>
<p>With jury terms continuing into the Fall of 2015, it is anticipated the last district court will conduct jury 
check-in during the first quarter of 2016. Therefore, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma expects to complete the installation of its electronic Jury Management System in 2016. This system will replace multiple jury management systems currently being used throughout the District Courts of Oklahoma.</p>
