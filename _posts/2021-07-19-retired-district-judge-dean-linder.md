title: Retired District Judge Dean Linder
---
A Celebration of Life for retired District Judge Dean Linder will be held Monday, July 19, 2021, at 1:30 p.m., at the Alva First Christian Church.  Judge Linder died last week surrounded by his family.  

Judge Linder was a stalwart in northwestern Oklahoma during his entire life.  He graduated from Waynoka High School, from Southwestern State College (now SWOSU), and from the OU College of Law.

His law career began in Alva in 1960 as County Attorney for Woods County.  He served as County Judge from 1967-1969, until judicial reform changed the position title to Associate District Judge, a position he held from 1969-1982.  In 1982 he was elected District Judge, Division 1, in the Fourth Judicial District, where he served until his retirement in 2015.

Judge Linder was an active member and past president of the Oklahoma Judicial Conference.  He served as Presiding Judge for the Northwest Administrative Judicial District.  As much as he loved and led in his judicial service, all who knew him were keenly aware of his love of hunting.  Judge Linder was a favorite guide for the annual Lt. Governor's Turkey Hunt and served as a host for the Alva site.

He is survived by his wife Wylodean, daughter Jana Pitt, son Jon Linder, daughter Julia Schrock, four grandchildren, two great grandchildren, and his sister Carolyn Calvery.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions be made to the Dean Linder Broadcast Scholarship, Northwestern Foundation and Alumni Association, or the First Christian Church Disciples of Christ, Alva.

Repeating Judge Linder's signature sign-off: "Good night and continue to be real good sports."
