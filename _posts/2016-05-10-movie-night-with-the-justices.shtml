<h4>Movie: Woman In Gold</h4>
<p>The film is based on the true story of the late Maria Altmann, an elderly Jewish
refugee, who, together with her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, fought the
government of Austria for almost a decade to reclaim Gustav Klimt's iconic
painting of her aunt, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I, which was stolen from her
relatives by the Nazis in Vienna just prior to World War II. Altmann took her
legal battle all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States, which ruled
on the case Republic of Austria v. Altmann (2004).</p>
