<p>To all members of the Oklahoma Judicial Conference:</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Judicial Conference Executive Board 
    invite you to the Oklahoma attend the 2015 Oklahoma Judicial Conference to be held 
    Wednesday, July 22, through Friday, July 24, 2015, at the new Embassy Suites, 
    Oklahoma City Downtown/Medical Center Hotel and Conference Center, 741 N. Phillips 
    Avenue, Oklahoma City, OK 73104 (one block east of Lincoln Blvd. at 8th Street).</p>
<p>The members of the OJC Executive Board have assembled an outstanding faculty and 
    request that you pre-register so that we can expedite the conference check-in 
    process. We will have a working luncheon on Friday, July 24, and the business meeting 
    will be conducted at that time. There will be no cost to you for the lunch, but 
    pre-registration is required for attendance. The dress code for the conference this 
    year will be casual; it will be summer after all! Complimentary Wi-Fi will be 
    available all three days.</p>
<p>We will continue to utilize technology making written materials available online at 
    OSCNConnect. You will receive an email which will contain a link to the online site. 
    Some of you may want to print selected materials or save them to the desktop and bring 
    your laptops or other devices with you so that you can access them during the 
    conference. Power outlets will be limited in the meeting rooms.</p>
<p>The education committee is trying a new format for the conference, focusing on break-out 
    sessions with a choice of four different topics each hour. The two plenary sessions 
    will be Kieran Maye with his Supreme Court review and Sarah Cravens on judicial ethics. 
    As in years past, Wednesday will be the juvenile law day.</p>
<p>For those of you staying at the hotel, I encourage you to enjoy the full breakfast that 
    is included in the price of your room. We are working on information to send to you of 
    all the activities going on in OKC/Bricktown during the conference. With such activities 
    as the boathouse district attractions, the trampoline park in Edmond, and the zoo as 
    well as all the wonderful new restaurants, there will surely be something for everyone 
    to enjoy. Please plan to bring your families to enjoy being in downtown Oklahoma City 
    this year.</p>
<p>Cordially, <br />

   OJC President</p>
