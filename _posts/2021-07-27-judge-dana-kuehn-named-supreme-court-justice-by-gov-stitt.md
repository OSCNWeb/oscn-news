Governor Stitt has announced that longtime jurist, Judge Dana Kuehn of Tulsa, has been appointed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  Judge Kuehn is the governor’s third appointment to the state’s highest court.  When she fills the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Tom Colbert, Kuehn will become only the fourth woman to serve on the Oklahoma Supreme Court.  For the first time in state history, three women will be serving as justices at the same time when Justice-select Kuehn joins Justice Yvonne Kauger and Justice Noma Gurich among the nine members of the Supreme Court.

At the time of her selection by Governor Stitt, Judge Kuehn was serving as the Presiding Judge of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, a position she has held since January, 2021.  A member of the OCCA since 2017, Kuehn served as Vice Presiding Judge from 2018-2020.  Kuehn is an active member of the Oklahoma Judicial Conference and has been serving as Appellate Judge Vice President for the OJC Executive Board.  Prior to serving on the Court of Criminal Appeals, Kuehn was the Associate District Judge in Tulsa County from 2006-2017.  Kuehn’s career includes experience as a private practice attorney and as a Tulsa County Assistant District Attorney.

Kuehn received her Juris Doctor from the University of Tulsa College of Law and her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from Oklahoma State University.  She has been an active member in her Tulsa community and has served on committees for the Oklahoma and Tulsa County Bar Associations.  She is a strong supporter of the University of Tulsa College of Law and active with its Alumni Board.  She attends First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa with her husband, Patrick, and four children.

Chief Justice Richard Darby has indicated that a formal ceremonial celebration for Justice-select Kuehn will be held at a later date.
