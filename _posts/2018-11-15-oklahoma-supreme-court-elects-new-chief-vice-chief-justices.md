title: 'Oklahoma Supreme Court Elects New Chief, Vice Chief Justices'
---
The Oklahoma Supreme Court today elected new leadership for the next two years, Chief Justice Douglas L. Combs announced Tuesday.  The Oklahoma Constitution requires the Court every two years to select from its members a Chief Justice and a Vice Chief Justice.

Noma D. Gurich was elected to the office of Chief Justice.  Gurich, the current Vice Chief Justice, has been a member of the Oklahoma Supreme Court since her appointment by Governor Henry in January, 2011.  A native of Indiana, she received her undergraduate degree from Indiana State University and her Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Oklahoma College of Law.  

Gurich is only the third woman to serve on the state's highest appellate court and as Chief Justice. Over her years of service, she has the unique distinction of being appointed to judicial office by four different governors after recommendation from the Judicial Nominating Commission.  Those four include Governors Henry Bellmon, David Walters, Frank Keating and Brad Henry.

Gurich has been a judge in the state of Oklahoma for 30 years, serving as a judge on the Oklahoma Workers Compensation Court and as a District Judge for Oklahoma County.  Prior to her judicial career, she practiced law for ten years in Oklahoma City.  She is married to John E. Miley, General Counsel of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission.

Patrick R. Wyrick will be the next Vice Chief Justice.  An Associate Justice since February, 2017, Wyrick was appointed to the Oklahoma Supreme Court by Governor Mary Fallin.  He received his law degree from the University of Oklahoma College of Law and began his legal career as a law clerk for federal judge James H. Payne of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. Following his clerkship, Wyrick was in private law practice when he was hired as the first Solicitor General in the office of the Oklahoma Attorney General. 

Wyrick, a fourth-generation native of Atoka, Oklahoma, attended the University of Oklahoma on a baseball scholarship. He and his wife, Jamie, have three children.

The Chief Justice presides at all court sessions, administers the judicial branch of state government, and represents the Supreme Court and judicial system in public appearances.  The new positions become effective January 1, 2019. 

Combs, who is concluding two years as Chief Justice, said, "as judges continue to face challenges in their courtrooms, Oklahoma's judicial branch of government will have strong leadership under the guidance of Justices Gurich and Wyrick."
