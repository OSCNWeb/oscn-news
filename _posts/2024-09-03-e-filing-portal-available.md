### Great News!

The Oklahoma Supreme Court and Management Information Services/Administrative Office of the Courts is pleased to announce the release of Electronic Filing (E-Filing). 

The E-Filing portal is available on the Oklahoma State Courts Network website at www.oscn.net. For the initial release, registered users can electronically submit filings into existing civil, non-confidential district court cases in specific counties see map below.  Future phased releases will grow participation by (1) enabling registration by additional types of filers, (2) e-filing to create new civil cases, e-filing in existing criminal cases, and e-filing in appellate cases.
