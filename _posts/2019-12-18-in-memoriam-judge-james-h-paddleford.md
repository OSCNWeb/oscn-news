<img style="width: 110px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://www.oscn.net/images/news/james-paddleford.jpg" />Former Oklahoma County Special Judge James H. Paddleford died Saturday, December 14, 2019, surrounded by his immediate family.  Judge Paddleford is survived by his wife, Pat; daughter, Stephenie Theriot and her husband Ricky Harrison; son, Jace Paddleford and his wife, Kim; stepson, Sean Maples; grandchildren Rylin and J.D. Paddleford; and sisters, Joan McCollom, Suzi Strauch and Marney Abel.

Judge Paddleford graduated from the Oklahoma City University School of Law and served a long career as a practicing attorney in Oklahoma City, Cashion and Piedmont.  He was recently recognized for 50 years membership in the Oklahoma Bar Association.  In 2009, he retired as Special Judge of the District Court in Oklahoma County.  While he has a long list of professional accomplishments, his family wishes him to be remembered as a loving father, husband, grandfather, brother and a great friend.

A gathering of family and friends will be held on Friday, December 20, from 6:00 â€“ 8:00 p.m., at Hahn-Cook/Street & Draper Funeral Home, 6600 Broadway Extension, Oklahoma City.
