<p>On Friday, April 10th, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma released its e-Payments system in Tulsa County. This is the third successful release of this popular online payment system customized for select district courts. "<em>We had citizens making payments within just a few hours after the e-Payments system was released in our office. I believe this type of response proves the public has been waiting for the opportunity to pay court costs online.</em>" said Sally Howe Smith, Tulsa County District Court Clerk.</p>

<p>"...I even had several defendants pay off their entire balance owed." - Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County Court Clerk</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The e-Payments system is a web-based application that allows online payments to be made by credit or debit card on criminal cases that have an outstanding balance due.  It was first piloted in Canadian and Cleveland counties in January 2015.  During the pilot stage the system successfully processed hundreds of online payment transactions.  “The e-Payments system runs smoothly.  It has made it convenient for defendants to make regular payments on payment plans, as well as catch up on any missed payments.  I even had several defendants pay off their entire balance owed.” said Rhonda Hall, Cleveland County District Court Clerk.</p>
<p>The e-Payments system was developed by the Supreme Court’s MIS Division and uses a secure third-party payment processor. MIS customized the system to seamlessly apply payments into the Supreme Court’s in-house case management system, OCIS or Oklahoma Court Information System.  Currently the system is installed in Canadian, Cleveland, and Tulsa counties.  Within the next few months, MIS will release the system to the remaining district courts that use the OCIS case management system.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"...I believe it is an enormous benefit for everyone involved" - Mike Kiss, Interim MIS Director</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The MIS Division designed the system with a user friendly interface that provides step-by-step instructions for making an online payment.  Receipts can be emailed to the user and/or printed.  Once a payment is processed through the e-Payments system, it is seamlessly integrated into the OCIS case management system.  The OCIS system automatically applies the payment to the applicable case and defendant, as well as updating the case with the appropriate financial entries.  The district court clerk simply prints a receipt for the official court record. “We have worked extremely hard to provide the district courts with this customized online payment system.  I believe it is an enormous benefit for everyone involved.  Not only will the public have the ease and convenience of paying court costs online, but the district courts will save time because the OCIS case management system automatically applies the payment to the case.” said Mike Kiss, Interim MIS Director.</p>
