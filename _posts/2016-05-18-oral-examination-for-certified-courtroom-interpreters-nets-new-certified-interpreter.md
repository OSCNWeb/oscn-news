<p>A series of Oral Examinations for Certified Courtroom Interpreters was administered in February and March, 2016.   Certification indicates the highest skill level for a court interpreter, and is the generally recognized standard in most state court systems.  Once an interpreter has become a Registered Courtroom Interpreter in Oklahoma,  s/he is then eligible to take the oral examination to become a Certified Courtroom Interpreter. Ms. Pilar Post of Tulsa achieved all requirements and has become the first Certified Courtroom Interpreter certified by the State of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The next test cycle for the Oral Examination will be September 14-16 and September 21-23, 2016. Applications for the oral examination will soon be available on the Supreme Court's website, <a href="http://www.oscn.net" target="_blank">www.oscn.net</a> under Programs, then Certified Courtroom Interpreters.</p>
