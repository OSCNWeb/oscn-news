<p>The Supreme Court of Oklahoma will soon release its new web-based e-Payments system on www.oscn.net. In the near future, paying outstanding court costs and fines will become more convenient in selected district courts.</p>
<p>e-Payments will enable the public to make secure online payments on cases and payment plans with outstanding balances in the Cleveland County District Court and the Canadian County District Court.</p>
<p>The e-Payments system was developed by the MIS Division of the Administrative Office of the Court, and it uses a third-party vendor for secure credit card processing.</p>
<p>The link to e-Payments will be on the home page of OSCN in the upper right-hand corner of the www.oscn.net website.<br>
