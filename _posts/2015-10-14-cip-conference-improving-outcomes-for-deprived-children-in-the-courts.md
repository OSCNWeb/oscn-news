<p>Over 700 professionals who work with deprived children in Oklahoma’s courts met at the Children’s Court Improvement Program (CIP) Summit on October 6 – 7 in Norman. Judges, district attorneys, lawyers for children, lawyers for parents,  child welfare workers and supervisors, Tribal Representatives, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASAs), members of the local Post Adjudication Review Boards, Child Permanency Mediators, and others received two days of specialized training and met in multidisciplinary groups to find ways to improve court practices so that children who have been removed from their homes can return home or find another permanent home safely and quickly. </p>
<p>Training included topics such as: the Indian Child Welfare Act; the impact of trauma on infants, children, and adolescents; educational needs and educational advocacy for children in foster care; foster parent voices in juvenile deprived cases; best practices for professionals who work with deprived children; child sex trafficking; and improving outcomes for deprived children in the courts.</p>

<p>Vice Chief Justice Douglas Combs presented the welcome on the first day, and Jari Askins, Administrative Director of the Courts, called on all in attendance on the second day to strengthen communication as a means to protect Oklahoma’s most vulnerable children. </p>
<p>The judges of the Juvenile Justice Oversight and Advisory Committee moderated and facilitated the general and breakout sessions. Numerous volunteers who serve on the CIP Task Force assisted with conference check-in, greeted and assisted speakers, and distributed and collected evaluation forms.  Organizations that supported the Summit in this way include Oklahoma Lawyers for Children, Oklahoma Department of Human Services - Child Welfare, the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services, Oklahoma City University School of Law, and the Administrative Office of the Courts.</p><div class="image pull-left">
