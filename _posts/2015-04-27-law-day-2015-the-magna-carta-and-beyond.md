<p>The Oklahoma Bar Association's annual Law Day observance and activities are underway. "Law Day ... is a reminder and a celebration of the role the rule of law plays in our country. The checks and balances among the branches found in our Constitution are a direct extension of Magna Carta's core tenet that leaders ... are subject to the same laws and consequences as the public. Law Day should also make us pause and reflect on the progress still to be made towards true equality for all under the law."</p>

Eight hundred years ago, the signing of the Magna Carta laid the foundation for the rule of law in England and later the United States and United Kingdom. Law Day, at its core, is a reminder and a celebration of the role the rule of law plays in our country. The checks and balances among the branches found in our Constitution are a direct extension of Magna Carta's core tenet that leaders (lawmakers and enforcers) are subject to the same laws and consequences as the public. Law Day should also make us pause and reflect on the progress still to be made towards true equality for all under the law.</p><p>The national observance of Law Day began in Oklahoma. Wewoka attorney and past OBA President Hicks Epton developed the idea for Law Day in the late 1950s, and it has evolved into a national celebration. This year Oklahomans will observe Law Day on April 30 with activities throughout the state. Oklahoma's Law Day theme coincides with the American Bar Association's commemoration of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta. Many activities will highlight the history of Magna Carta.</p><p>Law Day provides lawyers an opportunity to reach out to the public and shape a positive view of lawyers and the legal system. Be sure to call your county bar leaders to learn more about the events in your county; a summary of planned activities begins on page 810. If an event is not planned in your county â€” there is still time! Contact the OBA Law Day committee for ideas and assistance putting together a Law Day event.</p><p>The Law Day annual art and writing contests for students in kindergarten through 12th grade was a success with more than 1,200 entries. On March 31, contest winners from all over Oklahoma gathered in the Supreme Court's ceremonial chambers at the State Capitol. Students met Chief Justice John Reif, received their awards and toured the Capitol. A traveling exhibit about the history of the Magna Carta and a public discussion of the Magna Carta in the House chambers took place on the same day. It was a great opportunity for students and their families!</p><h4>ASK A LAWYER TV SHOW</h4><p>The <em>Ask A Lawyer</em> show is in the final stages of production at the time of this writing. Every year the show highlights important legal topics and the impact lawyers make on the lives of individuals. With the help of all our attorney volunteers, we will continue to offer 12 hours of nonstop free legal advice. The <em>Ask A Lawyer</em> television show is set to air Thursday, April 30, at 7 p.m. on OETA stations across the state. This year's show covers a wide range of topics of interest to Oklahomans.</p><p>The show will examine civil rights law and its intersection with schools. We will hear from two young men who successfully pursued a civil rights discrimination suit against their high school. We will also hear from lawyers representing schools, the state and individuals. They will share what parents, teachers and schools need to be aware of and learn how to prevent civil rights violations.</p><p>Many Oklahomans are directly impacted or have a friend or loved one directly impacted by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. In this segment you will hear from two young women who have benefited from this program and attorneys representing immigration clients and the United States.Wind energy is a growing industry in Oklahoma. The show speaks to landowners and attorneys about their experiences with the industry and what you need to know about wind energy leases</p><p>and productionChief Justice John Reif and OBA President David Poarch join in the celebration of Law Day. Justice Reif shares his thoughts on the Magna Carta and recognizes the student contest winners and their winning artwork. President Poarch shares with the viewers information about the good work lawyers are doing across the state.</p><h4>CONTESTS AND ACTIVITIES</h4><p>This year more than 1,200 students from across the state submitted entries centered on this year's theme, "Foundations of the Law: The Magna Carta and Beyond." This year, the focus continued on writing as we asked first-12th grades to focus on different aspects of the Law Day theme through grade appropriate writing prompts. Oklahoma's students submitted hundreds of essays demonstrating an excellent grasp of the subject matter. The high quality work made judging the contest a difficult task for Law Day Committee members! The winners have been announced, and the winning entries can be viewed at <a href="http://www.okbar.org" target="_blank">www.okbar.org</a> and on page 779 of this issue.</p><h4>FREE LEGAL ADVICE</h4><p>We are well underway in preparing for the statewide Ask A Lawyer call-in event, to be held on Thursday, April 30, when the public can call in for free legal advice for 12 nonstop hours. The Ask A Lawyer call-in event is a great way for all Oklahoma lawyers to participate in the celebration of Law Day. This annual event gives us a unique opportunity to provide a valuable community service while promoting a positive public image of attorneys and the OBA.</p><p>Callers statewide will be able to reach an attorney throughout the day on April 30. The OBA and the committee work with each county's Law Day chairperson in setting up a network of local phone numbers during the broadcast. Volunteer attorneys in each participating county staff the phones and answer questions for a predetermined time period. Oklahoma and Tulsa County attorneys work together to staff the toll-free, statewide telephone number from 9 a.m. - 9 p.m.</p><p>The help of Oklahoma bar members is needed to make this community service project a success. It takes a total of 30 attorneys for each two-hour shift to fully staff the statewide number. That effort, combined with the local county bars, creates a huge need for attorneys to step forward. To volunteer, contact your local county Law Day chairperson and the activities planned for each county are listed in a related story in this issue.</p><p>The Law Day Committee has again committed to branch out to the Latino community by offering free legal advice in Spanish. Each shift in Tulsa and Oklahoma City will need Spanish-speaking volunteers. If you speak Spanish or know non-attorneys who would volunteer to translate, we need your help!</p><h4>DIRECTIVE AND PROCLAMATION</h4><p>Continuing an OBA Law Day tradition, Chief Justice John Reif signed the Law Day Directive, encouraging courts to host Law Day events. Gov. Mary Fallin has again this year signed a proclamation designating May 1, 2015, as Law Day in Oklahoma. </p><h4>GET INVOLVED</h4><p>As we get ready to celebrate Law Day, the OBA Law Day Committee is already preparing for next year's Law Day activities.
