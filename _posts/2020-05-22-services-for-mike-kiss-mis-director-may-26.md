<img style="width: 110px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://www.oscn.net/images/news/michael-kiss.jpg" />Michael Joseph Kiss, leader of the MIS department for the Administrative Office of the Courts, died on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, in Tulsa at the age of 65 years.  Mike had been serving as the interim director of MIS since July 1, 2014, after previously working as OSCN Project Manager and MIS Director from September, 2002, until February, 2008. 

Mike grew up the middle of five children to devout Catholic parents in western Pennsylvania. As a boy growing up in the Pittsburgh area, one of Mike’s favorite pastimes was attending baseball games at Forbes Field to watch the Pirates play. Mike and his brothers usually sat above right field hoping to catch the attention of the legendary Roberto Clemente. Sports were always a passion of Mike’s, and while in high school, he organized the first CYO chapter at his parish in order to form a basketball team to compete in the Catholic school league.

Mike attended McKeesport Area Senior High School in Pennsylvania, graduating in the Class of 1972. After high school he attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, first as a Theology Major and later as a Russian Language and Literature Major. It was at ORU where Mike met his future wife, Kim Wilkerson. Mike completed his studies at West Virginia University in Morgantown, earning a degree in Russian Language and Literature and Slavic Studies. After graduation, Mike and Kim were married at St. Stephen’s Episcopal Church in McKeesport and settled in the Chicago area, where they resided for 10 years. Here Mike began his dynamic career in the fledgling field of information technology, first in the publishing sector, but later including the waste management industry, the 24/7 field of car rental, and culminating in state government.

In his current position with the Oklahoma Supreme Court, Mike’s unique qualities as an intelligent and visionary leader allowed him to work successfully with multiple disciplines and across state agencies to manage information services to the entire state judicial system for the people of Oklahoma. His humble and patient servant’s heart are qualities for which he was well-known and for which he will be greatly missed, both by his co-workers and by the Supreme Court he loved to serve.

Mike is survived by his wife, Kim; son, Andrew; daughter and son-in-law, Gloria and Brian Henderson; grandchildren, Christopher and Victoria Henderson, all of Broken Arrow; sister, Veronica Eddy; brothers, Louis Kiss (Joyce) and John (Denise) Kiss, all of Pennsylvania; brother, Robert Kiss, of Ohio; and numerous nieces, nephews, and cousins.  

Funeral Mass will be Tuesday, May 26, at 10:00 a.m. at the Church of St. Benedict, 2200 W. Ithica St., Broken Arrow.  Rosary will be Monday, May 25, at 7:00 p.m., at Hayhurst Funeral Home, 1660 South Elm Place, Broken Arrow.  Visitation will be Monday, May 25, from 4:00 – 7:00 p.m., at [Hayhurst Funeral Home](https://www.hayhurstfuneralhome.com/obituaries/Michael-Kiss/).
