<p>The Internal Revenue Service has announced an increase in the mileage reimbursement rate for 2015. Effective January 1, 2015, the rate will increase to $0.575 cents per mile. The new rate is for travel <u>incurred on and after January 1, 2015.</u><br>
(See Internal Revenue Notice 2014-79, released 12-9-14)</p>
<p>Claims for <u>travel through December 31, 2014</u> must be submitted on a separate travel claim form using the rate of $0.56 cents per mile, even if the claims are submitted after January 1st.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you use the EXCEL automated travel claim form you will need to change the mileage reimbursement rate on your form to .575 cents per mile for calendar year 2015. When you change the rate the formula in the form will calculate your mileage at the new rate.</p>
