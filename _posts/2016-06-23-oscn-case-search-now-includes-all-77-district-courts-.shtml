<p>Cimarron County was recently added to the Oklahoma Supreme Court's website, OSCN.net, making it the 77th district court available for case record searches.  With the addition of Cimarron County, the public now has a free and a convenient way to perform district court case searches statewide, as well as the appellate courts.</p>
<p>This searchable online database was designed and developed by the MIS Division of the Administrative Office of Courts (AOC). This technology does not replace the two case management systems used by the district courts to file cases and documents.  Instead it provides the public a centralized location to search court records and view related documents online.</p>
<p>Providing a statewide online case search for the public is a major accomplishment for the courts.  For many years OSCN case search included only 13 district courts; however, in early 2015, the MIS Division began its Statewide Case Search Project. The first project release included five district courts and seven more courts added shortly thereafter. These releases allowed the MIS Division to better understand the various formatting of disparate databases and images found within the case management system used by 64 district courts. Once the MIS Division developed a repeatable process to capture this disparate case information it was able to release 52 district courts in 2016.</p>
<p>OSCN's case search is a free service that provides the public a convenient way to search for court records in the district and appellate courts by case number, name, date of birth, and other identifiers. Search results are fast, and case information is available almost immediately after being processed by the court clerk's office. In addition to online case information, site visitors may view court-related documents online; however, document availability will vary by district court.
