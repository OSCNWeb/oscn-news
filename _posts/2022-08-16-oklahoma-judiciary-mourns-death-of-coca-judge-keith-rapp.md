Judge Keith Rapp, a member of the Court of Civil Appeals since 1984, died on Tuesday, August 16, 2022, at the age of 88 years.  A native of Wheelersburg, Ohio, Judge Rapp received a bachelor’s degree from Southwest Missouri University, a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Tulsa, and a Master of Laws degree from the University of Virginia.  In law school, he was named Outstanding First-Year Law Student, awarded a Scholarship Key, named three times to the Dean’s List, and a member of the Tulsa Law Review.  

Prior to law school, as an aerospace engineer specializing in guidance and navigations systems, he worked on the Mercury, Apollo, Lunar Lander and Skylab projects. He has publications in these areas, including original research in mathematics. Rapp served two aircraft carrier tours off the coasts of Korea and Formosa as a navigator bombardier.  He was an instructor of Sino-Soviet Relations and Atomic and Biological Warfare in the Naval Reserves Officers School. From 1953-1955, he served in the United States Naval Reserves, retiring as a Judge Advocate General Corps Commander. Rapp also served as a business law instructor at Tulsa Junior College, later serving Tulsa Community College as a regent.  

After law school, Rapp worked as a public defender in Tulsa, city prosecutor in Broken Arrow, municipal judge in Bixby, and alternate municipal judge for the City of Tulsa.  He served the 14th Judicial District as District Judge until Governor George Nigh appointed him to the Court of Civil Appeals, District 2, Office 2, in 1984.  He was the longest-serving judge on the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals and won his 2020 retention election with a 64% favorable vote.  

Rapp is a member of the Tulsa County and Oklahoma Bar Associations, as well as holding membership in the bar associations of the U.S. Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.  He also served his community as a member of the Tulsa Arts Council Advisory Board.  He is survived by his wife, Mary Lynn; son, Joe Rapp and his wife, Laura; daughter, Liz Harris; daughter, Kathy Carlsen and her husband, Bill; nine grandchildren; and his beloved dog, Lilly.

"Judge Rapp was truly a scholar and a gentleman.  His years of judicial experience and his kindness to everyone will be remembered and missed by his colleagues at the Court of Civil Appeals and all members of the Oklahoma judiciary," reflected Chief Justice Richard Darby.
