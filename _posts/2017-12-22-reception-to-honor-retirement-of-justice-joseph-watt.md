<img style="width: 110px; float: right; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src='http://www.oscn.net/images/news/justice-watt-to-retire.jpg' />A reception to honor retiring Oklahoma Supreme Court Justice Joseph Watt will be held on Tuesday, January 9, 2018,  from 2:00 - 4:30 p.m., in the Great Room on the 3rd floor of the Oklahoma Judicial Center, 2100 N. Lincoln Blvd., Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Justice Watt announced his retirement to Governor Mary Fallin, effective December 31, 2017.  Watt, justice for the 9th Supreme Court Judicial District, began his judicial service in 1985, when he was appointed special judge for Jackson County.  He was elected associate district judge in 1986.  In 1991, Governor David Walters named Watt as his General Counsel.  He was appointed by Walters to the Oklahoma Supreme Court on May 17, 1992, and is in his 26th year of service on the high court.  He served two terms as chief justice, from 2003 until 2007.

"Having spent almost half of my entire life serving in the judicial branch of government, the past 25 1/2 years on the Supreme Court have been the most rewarding of my entire life," Watt said. "As the new year dawns, I look forward to beginning the next chapter in my life spending more quality time with my grandchildren, traveling with my wife, Cathy, and taking active retired status beginning January 1, 2018."  

"Justice Watt has served the state well while being on the bench for more than 30 years, including the past 25 years as a Supreme Court justice," said Fallin. "He's been a man of integrity, and has served with distinction.  I appreciate his knowledge, dedication and fairness while on the high court.  I wish him the best in his retirement and want to thank his wife and family, too, for their sacrifice and service to our state."

Watt earned a bachelor's degree in history/government from Texas Tech University and a doctor of jurisprudence from the University of Texas Law School.  In 1973, he and his wife moved to Altus, where he worked in private law practice and served as Altus city prosecutor until 1985.
