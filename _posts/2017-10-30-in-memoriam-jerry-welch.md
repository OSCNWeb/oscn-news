The Honorable Jerry Neil Welch, former Pushmataha County Associate District Judge, passed from this life on Friday, October 20, 2017 at the age of 83.

Jerry was born in Antlers, July 10, 1934 to Fitzhugh Lee & Arlene (Jennings) Welch. He was a 1952 graduate of Antlers High School and served in the U.S. Army from 1954-1956. He earned an undergraduate degree in Economics with minors in Speech, and English from Southeastern Oklahoma State University. He then earned his law degree from the University of Oklahoma Law School, graduating in 1963. He served as Pushmataha County Associate District Judge from 1975-1978, and had recently been recognized as a 50-year member of the Oklahoma Bar Association. Jerry was extremely intelligent, eccentric and though it wasn’t always apparent he was kind hearted. He didn’t practice law for financial gain, but rather because it challenged him. He would never turn away someone in need.

Jerry is preceded in death by his parents, and two brothers: Charles and William.

He leaves behind a loving family that includes daughters: Pamela and husband Raymond Huskins of Valliant, Kimberly Welch, close friend; Troy Splawn of Antlers, a granddaughter Kayla and husband Blake Cantrell, great grandchildren: Tycen, Kameron, and Brancen, sisters: Elizabeth Welch of Scottsdale, Arizona, Margaret Summers of Tulsa, nephews Bill Welch and Joe Welch as well as other family members, colleagues and friends.
