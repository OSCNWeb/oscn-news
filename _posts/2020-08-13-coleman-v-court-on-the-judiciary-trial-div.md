2020 OK JUD 1, CJAD-2020-1, Decided 08/13/2020  

Â¶1 On August 10, 2020, the Petitioner filed a Petition for Rehearing concerning this Court's August 7, 2020, Order granting the Application to Assume Original Jurisdiction and Petition for Writ of Prohibition and/or Mandamus and denying all relief requested. The Petition for Rehearing requests, in the alternative, findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Okla.Sup.Ct.R. 1.201 and 1.202 which concern summary dispositions and summary opinions in appeals. The Appellate Division has not adopted these specific rules of the Oklahoma Supreme Court nor do these rules mandate any action of this Court. However, for purposes of granting the Petitioner an explanation as to why relief was denied, we grant the Petition for Rehearing.
