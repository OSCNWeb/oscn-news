He served as a Special Judge in Oklahoma County from 1988 to 2002, when he was appointed to serve as a District Judge. He retired in 2005 and moved to Paradise Velley, AZ.  David was raised in Duncan and was a proud 1958 "Duncan Demon" graduate. David spent one year playing football at The University of Tulsa and went on to graduate from The University of Oklahoma in 1963. He received his law degree from Oklahoma City University in 1966.  Judge Harbour began his career as an assistant city attorney in Oklahoma City from 1966-1969.  He continued practicing law in Oklahoma City until he was appointed Special Judge.  He was an avid OU Sooner fan and enjoyed playing golf.   In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the [American Cancer Society](https://donate3.cancer.org/?campaign=legacy2&giftFirstName=DAVID&giftLastName=HARBOUR&giftType=mem) or National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum of Oklahoma City.  A memorial and celebration of life will be forthcoming when possible.
