<img style="width: 110px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://www.oscn.net/images/news/mike-evans.jpg" />Michael D. Evans, former Administrative Director of the Courts, died suddenly Sunday, December 17, 2017, in Edmond. Prior to serving the Administrative Office of the Courts from February 1, 2006- August 31, 2015, Mike maintained his law practice in Frederick. Since leaving the AOC, he had enjoyed practicing law with his son-in-law from offices in Bricktown in Oklahoma City. Mike is survived by his wife, Vonnie Evans, his two daughters, Kay Evans Thompson and her husband Bobby, and Kelly Evans Whitworth and her husband Clint; and his grandchildren, Cody Thompson, Ryan Cosby, Logan Thompson, Tanner Thompson, Jack Whitworth, and Ben Whitworth; and his sister, Patricia Evans.

An active member of the Oklahoma Bar Association, Mike served the OBA in numerous capacities before fulfilling a dream and serving as OBA president. He loved the law and the lawyers who served it.  This was evident when he appeared in courts throughout southwest Oklahoma. Prepared and polite, he was known as a "kind soul." 

Mike carried that same kindness to the AOC in his treatment of employees and district court personnel.  His support of the Alternative Dispute Resolution/Early Settlement Mediation program continued after the AOC with his training and involvement as a mediator for the program. He recently participated in the annual Volunteer Mediator Summit this past October.

A Celebration of Life will be held at the First Baptist Church, 201 East Grand, Frederick, OK, on Thursday, December 21, at 10:00 a.m. Private family burial will be in the Carney Cemetery under direction of Jackson Funeral Home of Frederick. Memorial contributions may be made to the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation - Heart Division in memory of Mike Evans.
