<img style="width: 110px; float: left; margin: 0 10px 10px 0;" src="http://www.oscn.net/images/news/mike-evans.jpg" />Michael D. Evans, former Administrative Director of the Courts, died suddenly Sunday, December 17, 2017, in Edmond. Prior to serving the Administrative Office of the Courts from February 1, 2006- August 31, 2015, Mike maintained his law practice in Frederick. Since leaving the AOC, he had enjoyed practicing law with his son-in-law from offices in Bricktown in Oklahoma City. Mike is survived by his wife, Vonnie Evans and daughters Kay Thompson and Kelly Whitworth and their families.

An active member of the Oklahoma Bar Association, Mike served the OBA in numerous capacities before fulfilling a dream and serving as OBA president. He loved the law and the lawyers who served it.  This was evident when he appeared in courts throughout southwest Oklahoma. Prepared and polite, he was known as a "kind soul." 

Mike carried that same kindness to the AOC in his treatment of employees and district court personnel.  His of the Alternative Dispute Resolution/Early Settlement Mediation program continued after the AOC with his training and involvement as a mediator for the program. He recently participated in the annual Volunteer Mediator Summit this past October.

Funeral services are pending with Jackson Funeral Home of Frederick.  Further details will be provided when arrangements have been made.
