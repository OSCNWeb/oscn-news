<p>Retired Judge Charles L. Owens passed away on Tuesday, May 24, 2016 with his wife of 59 years Edythe by his side. He was born and raised in Tulsa and graduated from Booker T. Washington High School.  He earned a bachelor's degree in business administration and a minor in economics from Lincoln University in Jefferson City, MO.  After serving in the U.S. Army he returned to Tulsa and became a police officer, while attending the Tulsa University College of Law.  In 1960 he became one of the first African American to earn a Juris Doctorate from TU.</p>
<p>In 1963 he made history as the first African-American assistant attorney general in Oklahoma. Five years later, he broke the color barrier again when he was appointed as a District Judge in Oklahoma County, a seat he held for more than three decades.  In that capacity, he handled many challenging cases, including presiding over the murder trial of the Sirloin Stockade killer, Roger Dale Stafford.  Indeed, just before Judge Owens sentenced Stafford for the murder of six people Mr. Stafford thanked him for conducting a fair trial.</p>
<p>Judge Owens has been the recipient of numerous awards over the years including the OBA Trailblazer Award in 2012. He received the award because of his remarkable leadership and lasting impact on many of Oklahoma's current attorneys, judges and African-American leaders. Judge Owens was an incredible jurist and he will be missed.</p>
<p>The funeral for Judge Charles L. Owens will be held at 12:00 PM on Wednesday, June 1, 2016, at Corpus Christi Catholic Church, 1616 N. Kelley Ave, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.</p>
